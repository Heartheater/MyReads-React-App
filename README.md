# MyReads app

This is a book tracking app using React that lets you keep a catalogue of books on three seperate shelves: Reading, Want to Read, and already Read.

You can add new books to these shelves by searching for them using the search function within the app.


## Running the app
* Download the app
* Go into the app directory folder and install dependencies with `npm install`
* Finally, launch the app with `npm start`

## Using the Search

MyReads app uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in `SEARCH_TERMS.md`.
